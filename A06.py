#wrap the code from A 05 inside a while loop and allow as many conversions
#as the user wants.
#Here are some points to add to the A 05 mix:
#1) Use a while loop so that the user can convert as many temperatures as they like.
#2) To exit the loop, the use can enter either a lower case ‘x’ or upper case ‘X’.
#3) If an error is detected, print an error message and loop again.
